# Case:
Given a group of friends who went on a vacation together and didn't split all their bills, write a function that help us plan payments to settle the debts of each one of them.
# Example:
PS: In the following example we refer to the dept balance with "balance": if the balance is negative, that means that the person should be paying. <br/>
After the trip, if Pif has a balance of 500, Paf has a balance of -300 and Pouf has a balance of -200, then the payments that should be made are:
- Paf to Pif: 300
- Pouf to Pif: 200
# Expected output:
When running "rspec debt_planner_fares.rb", the test should pass.
